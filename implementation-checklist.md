# META-ORCHESTRATOR IMPLEMENTATION CHECKLIST v1.1

## PMCR-O Cycle Status: PLANNER Phase
**Activation Date:** January 2, 2026
**Current Phase:** PLANNER → MAKER → CHECKER → REFLECTOR → ORCHESTRATOR

## Phase 1: PLANNER (Current - Active)
- [x] Analyze meta-orchestrator prompt structure and requirements
- [x] Define integration points with existing PMCR-O system
- [x] Create orchestration manifest JSON
- [x] Establish cycle state tracking mechanism
- [x] Design BIP logic validation framework
- [ ] Create phase transition protocols
- [ ] Define artifact generation templates
- [ ] Establish logging and tracing mechanisms

## Phase 2: MAKER (Next - Pending)
- [ ] Implement meta-orchestrator core logic
- [ ] Create cycle state management system
- [ ] Build artifact generation pipeline
- [ ] Integrate with existing Cursor tooling
- [ ] Add enterprise logging capabilities
- [ ] Create self-verification mechanisms
- [ ] Implement thought transfer protocols

## Phase 3: CHECKER (Future - Pending)
- [ ] Validate BIP logic execution
- [ ] Test phase transitions
- [ ] Verify artifact generation
- [ ] Check integration with existing systems
- [ ] Validate security and performance
- [ ] Test error handling and recovery
- [ ] Confirm backward compatibility

## Phase 4: REFLECTOR (Future - Pending)
- [ ] Analyze implementation effectiveness
- [ ] Identify performance bottlenecks
- [ ] Review user experience feedback
- [ ] Assess system resilience
- [ ] Evaluate scalability potential
- [ ] Document lessons learned
- [ ] Propose system improvements

## Phase 5: ORCHESTRATOR (Future - Pending)
- [ ] Coordinate next development cycle
- [ ] Implement approved improvements
- [ ] Update system documentation
- [ ] Train on new capabilities
- [ ] Establish monitoring dashboards
- [ ] Create automated testing pipelines
- [ ] Prepare for production deployment

## Integration Requirements
### Existing System Compatibility
- [ ] Maintain PMCR-O_MASTER_SEED.md integrity
- [ ] Preserve ARCHITECTURE_VALIDATION.md structure
- [ ] Align with CONTENT_ROADMAP_2026.md
- [ ] Support current site domains (shawndelainebellazan.com, tooensure.com)

### Tooling Integration
- [ ] Cursor IDE primary runtime support
- [ ] Browser tools for validation
- [ ] Terminal commands for execution
- [ ] File operations for artifact management

## Quality Assurance
### BIP Logic Validation
- [x] CHECK 1: Runtime and tooling confirmation ✓
- [x] CHECK 2: Seed intent restatement ✓
- [x] CHECK 3: Phase selection logic ✓
- [x] CHECK 4: External validation handling ✓
- [x] CHECK 5: Artifact generation ✓

### Security & Performance
- [ ] No external validation claims without evidence
- [ ] Template-based implementation (no hard-coded values)
- [ ] Forward-only cycle progression
- [ ] Enterprise-grade logging implementation
- [ ] Error boundary and recovery mechanisms

## Success Metrics
- [ ] 100% BIP logic compliance
- [ ] Zero backward phase jumps
- [ ] All artifacts generated as specified
- [ ] Full integration with existing systems
- [ ] Performance within acceptable thresholds
- [ ] User acceptance and validation

**Next Action:** Transition to MAKER phase upon checklist completion
**Estimated Completion:** Phase 1 complete, Phase 2 ready for execution
